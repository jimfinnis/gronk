# Markdown
A quick guide to the markdown we support here.

## Headings and emphasis
* Headings are done by multiple # at the start of a line.
* Emphasis is done using `*this*` for *italics* and `**this**` for **bold**, or _this_
* Horizontal lines are done with `---` on a line

---

## Code
* Inline code is done with backticks.
* Code blocks are done with 8 space indents (not 4, weirdly)


        here's a code block.

## Links
WikiLinks are supported, so `[[index]]` will work (a so-called "WikiLink"): [[index]].
Alternatively, you can use  `[text](pagename or URL)`, so `[return to index](/index)` should work: [return to index](/index).
Note the slash at the start of the URL, that's important
